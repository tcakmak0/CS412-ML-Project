# CS412-ML-Project
CS412 Instagram Data Analysis Project

# Overview
This repository contains the scripts and models used for the Fall 2024-2025 CS412 Term Project and the results obtained.

The first thing done was feature analysis. This [file] ./feature_analysis_profile.ipynb contains code to traverse the given dataset and examine the features. 
We eliminate features we think are irrelevant and check if there are null-values to be dealt with. We drop features that are mostly null. Also we drop features with low variance.

Then in this [file] ./feature_extraction_profile.ipynb , we tfidf-vectorize our textual data and merge some of the features together. How we handled the textual data and how we used categorical data impacted our classification score considerably. In this file we also tried some initial classifiers like Random Forest, and Word2Vec. It also includes our final BERT classifier.

Finally, our last [file] ./regression_randomforest.ipynb includes our regression model, built on the instructive notebook provided.
